Solar Tracking System using Arduino
Project Overview

This project involves designing and implementing a solar tracking system using an Arduino microcontroller. 
The system aims to maximize electric power output of solar panels by automatically adjusting their position to track the movement of the sun throughout the day.

Features
Dual-axis tracking: The system can move the solar panel in both horizontal (azimuth) and vertical (elevation) directions.
Real-time adjustment: Continuously adjusts the position of the solar panel to ensure it is always perpendicular to the sun's rays.
Low power consumption: Designed to be energy efficient, using minimal power for operations.

Components:
- Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega
- Servo motor for horizontal movement
- Stepper motor for vertical movement
- Solar panel
- Motor driver module
- Miscellaneous components: resistors, wires, breadboard, etc.
- Circuit Diagram
